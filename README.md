## Reflection

### Next Feature to Add
If this website supported a real daycare, I would add an **online enrollment portal** allowing parents to:
- Complete registration forms online
- Upload required documents (immunization records, emergency contacts)
- Pay deposits and tuition securely
- Access a parent portal for daily updates and photos

### Operational and Security Risks at Scale

**Security Risks:**
- Child data protection and COPPA compliance
- Payment security with PCI-DSS compliance
- Photo privacy with secure parent-only access
- Secure login systems for parent portals

**Operational Risks:**
- Maintaining state childcare licensing requirements
- Ongoing staff background checks
- Emergency contact and pickup authorization systems
- Regular backup of enrollment and child records
